# Neural_Network_Package

This code contains a function to fit Neural Network Models. I have tested the code for MNIST and notMNIST datasets. 
I start this project to understand gradient based optimization in Neural Networks. The function can be used to fit Neural Networks 
with varying number of layers. I have provided with 2 options for activation layer. You can easily change the code in helper.py to accomodate 
for a different kind of activation function.
